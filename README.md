# SONIC1-SMS-OZ80
Disassembly of Sonic 1 ("Sonic the Hedgehog", 8-Bit) for the SEGA Master System in OZ80 ('OZ80MANDIAS') format, but with the unused stuff being used in the game 
this is basically a disassembly of the 8-Bit version of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game and btw yes there is an official 8 bit version of Sonic 1 that SEGA made and published if you didnt know that,
but i am making the unused stuff get used again, also fun fact Sonic 1 and its 8-Bit counterpart are actually different,
also yes Sonic 1 was on the Master System and the 8-Bit game came after the SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive's 16 bit Sonic 1, also the 8 bit is licensed by SEGA and yeah also you probably
dont know this but the 8 bit Sonic 1 was not made by Aspect it was made by Ancient and Aspect just made the other 8 Bit Sonic games also
i might be releasing this version but idk if i should bc i dont want SEGA to get mad but it kinda doesnt matter bc SEGA havent gotten mad at hidden palace and the cutting room floor,
btw i didnt make this disassembly, i only just forked it and im just updating it and adding unused stuff
